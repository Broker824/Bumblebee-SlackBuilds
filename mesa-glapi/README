This package contains the Mesa GLAPI library that is needed for
certain applications to satisfy their symbol dependencies.

Do not upgrade this package version unless you know what you are doing.
The version needs to be consistent with Slackware's Mesa version.

This SlackBuild can build and package 32-bit compatible binaries and
libraries for x86_64 systems. To enable this, pass the variable COMPAT32:

  # COMPAT32=yes ./mesa-glapi.SlackBuild
