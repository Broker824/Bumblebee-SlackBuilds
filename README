This set of SlackBuilds should get Bumblebee up and running to aid in
running OpenGL application on an NVIDIA Optimus setup.

TODO:
- bumblebee
  - Use the distribution-agnostic installer
  - Hardware detection in doninst.sh for xorg.conf.nvidia
- nvidia-bumblebee
  - Build nvidia-settings from source
  - Build nvidia-xconfig from source
- VirtualGL
  - Multilib for x86_64 systems

If you're looking for SlackBuilds for bbswitch and bumblebeed, the latest
bumblebee setup, please checkout the development branch:

HowTo:

If you have never used a SlackBuild before, please refer to the HowTo
on SlackBuilds.org: http://slackbuilds.org/howto/

1. Create a bumblebee group:
     # groupadd bumblebee
   
   Add users to the group:
     # usermod -G bumblebee -a USERNAME
   
   Note: you will need to re-login as the user for this to take effect

2. Build and install VirtualGL

3. Build and install nvidia-bumblebee
   
   Optional if you're using nouveau
   
4. Build and install nvidia-kernel
   
   Optional if you're using nouveau
   
5. Build and install acpi_call
   
   This might be an optional step for you.  If optimus is enabled by
   default for you, and you don't want to have power control in
   Bumblebee, you "should not" need this.

6. Build and install bumblebee

7. Run the rc.bumblebee script:
     # chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.bumblebee
     # /etc/rc.d/rc.bumblebee start
   
   Now an application can run with optirun:
     $ optinrun glxgears
