This set of SlackBuilds should get Bumblebee up and running to aid in
running OpenGL application on an NVIDIA Optimus setup.

HowTo:

If you have never used a SlackBuild before, please refer to the HowTo
on SlackBuilds.org: http://slackbuilds.org/howto/


1. Create group: bumblebee:
     # groupadd bumblebee
   
   Add users to the group:
     # usermod -G bumblebee -a USERNAME
   
   Note: you will need to re-login as the user for this to take effect

2. Build and install: libjpeg-turbo
   
   If the system is x86_64 based, 32-bit compatible binaries and
   libraries can be installed via:
   
     # COMPAT32=yes ./libjpeg-turbo.SlackBuild

3. Build and install: VirtualGL
   
   If the system is x86_64 based, 32-bit compatible binaries and
   libraries can be installed via:
   
     # COMPAT32=yes ./VirtualGL.SlackBuild

4. Build and install: nvidia-bumblebee (Optional, if using nouveau)
   
   If the system is x86_64 based, 32-bit compatible binaries and
   libraries can be installed via:
   
     # COMPAT32=yes ./nvidia-bumblebee.SlackBuild

5. Build and install: nvidia-kernel (Optional, if using nouveau)

6. Build and install: bbswitch (Optional)
   
   This in an optional requirement.  If you do not need power management or
   the ability to turn off the nVidia chip, you can skip this.

7. Build and install: libbsd

8. Build and install: bumblebeed

9. Run the rc.bumblebee script:
     # chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.bumblebeed
     # /etc/rc.d/rc.bumblebeed start
   
   Now an application can run with optirun:
     $ optirun glxgears
