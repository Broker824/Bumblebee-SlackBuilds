A kernel module that enables you to call ACPI methods by writing the
method name followed by arguments to /proc/acpi/call.

You can build the acpi_call module for a different kernel:
  KERNEL=3.0.0 ./acpi_call.SlackBuild

You can build the acpi_call module with a different build path:
  KERNELPATH=/lib/modules/3.0.0/build ./acpi_call.SlackBuild
