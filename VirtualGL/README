VirtualGL is an open source package which gives any Unix or Linux
remote display software the ability to run OpenGL applications with
full 3D hardware acceleration.

This SlackBuild can build and package 32-bit compatible binaries and
libraries for x86_64 systems. To enable this, pass the variable COMPAT32:

  # COMPAT32=yes ./VirtualGL.SlackBuild
