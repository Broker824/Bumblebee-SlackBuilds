Bumblebee daemon is a rewrite of the original Bumblebee service,
providing an elegant and stable means of managing Optimus hybrid
graphics chipsets.  A primary goal of this project is to not only
enable use of the discrete GPU for rendering, but also to enable
smart power management of the dGPU when it's not in use.

You will need a usergroup called "bumblebee" for the bumblebee daemon:
  # groupadd bumblebee

Then add any users that should have optimus access to the group:
  # usermod -G bumblebee -a USERNAME

This package requires: bbswitch, libbsd, nvidia-bumblebee, VirtalGL
