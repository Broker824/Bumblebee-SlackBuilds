Bumblebee aims to provide support for nVidia Optimus laptops for
GNU/Linux distributions. Using Bumblebee, you can use your nVidia card
for rendering graphics which will be displayed using the Intel card.

You will need a usergroup called "bumblebee" for the bumblebee daemon:
  # groupadd bumblebee

Then add any users that should have optimus access to the group:
  # usermod -G bumblebee -a USERNAME

This package requires: nvidia-bumblebee, VirtalGL
